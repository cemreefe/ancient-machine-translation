# Machine Translation for Ancient Languages
> In this repository I'll play around with the idea of using machine translation techniques to perform translations to and from ancient languages including Akkadian, Ancient Greek, Ancient Egyptian etc.

### Why?
I have searched on the web for a machine translation service to help me translate some stuff to Ancient Greek, only to find no such service exists.

That got me thinking, why is there no machine translation service for any ancient languages other than Latin? The reason probably is simple, **there is not enough data**.

Even though there is a great chance I will not succeed I wanted to take my chances. Even if I don't manage to get it working I can learn more about **scraping** disorganized data, **NLP** techniques and working with ancient languages.
